# BSD Nebula

A BSD Nebula is the forming ground of [BSD Solar Systems](https://github.com/brightsidedeveloper/bsd-solar-system). Here you can manage the different projects you need with a database and server to orchestrate communication between your different solar systems and report back to the overarching [BSD Galaxy](https://github.com/brightsidedeveloper/bsd-galaxy).
